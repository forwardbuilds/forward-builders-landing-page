# Forward Builders — Static Landing Page

This is a **deploy-ready static site** (no build step) that Vercel can host immediately.

## Files
- `index.html` — homepage (fixes the 404 by ensuring a root index)
- `style.css` — simple navy/white/gold styling
- `script.js` — mailto contact form handler
- `README.md` — these instructions

## How to Deploy (GitHub → Vercel)
1. **Unzip** this folder on your computer.
2. Go to your GitHub repo (the one connected to Vercel).
3. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
4. Drag **index.html**, **style.css**, **script.js**, and **README.md** into GitHub.
5. Click **Commit changes**.
6. Vercel will auto-redeploy. Open your Vercel URL to see the live site.

**Note:** The phone number is at the very top (gold bar). It’s both **selectable** (for copy/paste) and **clickable** (`tel:` link). The contact form opens your email client to send details to **forwardbuilds@gmail.com**.
